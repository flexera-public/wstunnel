#! /usr/bin/make
#
# Makefile for Golang projects, v0.9.0
#
# Features:
# - runs ginkgo tests recursively, computes code coverage report
# - code coverage ready for travis-ci to upload and produce badges for README.md
# - build for linux/amd64, linux/arm, darwin/amd64, windows/amd64
# - just 'make' builds for local OS/arch
# - produces .tgz/.zip build output
# - bundles *.sh files in ./script subdirectory
# - produces version.go for each build with string in global variable VV, please
#   print this using a --version option in the executable
# - to include the build status and code coverage badge in CI use (replace NAME by what
#   you set $(NAME) to further down, and also replace magnum.travis-ci.com by travis-ci.org for
#   publicly accessible repos [sigh]):
#   [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/rightscale/NAME.svg?token=4Q13wQTY4zqXgU7Edw3B&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/rightscale/NAME

# Top-level targets:
# default: compile the program, you can thus use make && ./NAME -options ...
# build: builds binaries for linux and darwin
# test: runs unit tests recursively and produces code coverage stats and shows them
# travis-test: just runs unit tests recursively
# clean: removes build stuff
